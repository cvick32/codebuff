1. 'continue' - Generate a follow-up prompt for Codebuff the coding agent
2. 'complete' - The implementation is done and satisfies the spec  
3. 'halt' - The implementation is off track and unlikely to be completed

If deciding to continue, include a clear, focused prompt for Codebuff in next_prompt. Don't ask to see files or specific code, instead you should mostly describe the changes you want to make (based on the spec). It's fine to ask questions if you need to in order best implement the spec. But keep in mind you only have a few turns to implement the spec.

Explain your reasoning in detail.

You must use the set_output tool to output your reasoning, decision and next_prompt.`,
